I don't play the lottery but my family does. I was given the idea to scrape historic lottery numbers so my family members could have a competitive edge.
Well I did exactly that starting with Lotto 649!

Conclusion:
1. There is essentially an equal distribution in the numbers drawn
2. There is no correlation in any pairs of numbers
3. Even the most highly correlated pairs (statiscially no corr.) never appear in single draw

Ultimately, statistics won't help you beat Lotto 649, but what about the other lottos?
